<span><p><i>Catfis are a diverse group of ray-finned fish. 
    Named for their prominent barbels, which resemble a cat's whiskers, catfish range in size and behavior from the three largest species alive, the Mekong giant catfish from Southeast Asia, the wels catfish of Eurasia, and the pira√≠ba of South America, to detritivores (species that eat dead material on the bottom), and even to a tiny parasitic species commonly called the candiru, Vandellia cirrhosa. Neither the armour-plated types nor the naked types have scales. Despite their name, not all catfish have prominent barbels or "whiskers". Members of the Siluriformes order are defined by features of the skull and swimbladder. 
    Catfish are of considerable commercial importance; many of the larger species are farmed or fished for food. Many of the smaller species, particularly 
    the genus Corydoras, are important in the aquarium hobby.</i></p></span>

<span><p><i>Swordfish (Xiphias gladius), also known as broadbillsin some countries, are large, 
    highly migratory predatory fish characterized by a long, flat, pointed bill. 
    They are a popular sport fish of the billfish category, though elusive. Swordfish are elongated, round-bodied, and
     lose all teeth and scales by adulthood. These fish are found widely in tropical and temperate parts of the Atlantic, Pacific,
      and Indian Oceans, and can typically be found from near the surface to a depth of 550 m (1,800 ft), and exceptionally up to 
      depths of 2,234 m.They commonly reach 3 m (10 ft) in length, and the maximum reported is 4.55 m (14 ft 11 in) in length 
      and 650 kg (1,430 lb) in weight.
    They are the sole member of their family, Xiphiidae.</i></p></span>

    <span><p><i>The Goldfish (Carassius auratus) is a freshwater fish in the family Cyprinidae of 
        order Cypriniformes. It is commonly kept as a pet in indoor aquariums, and is one of the most popular aquarium fish. Goldfish released 
        into the wild have become an invasive pest in parts of North America.
        Native to China, the goldfish is a relatively small member of the carp family 
        (which also includes the Prussian carp and the crucian carp). It was first selectively bred for color in 
        imperial China more than 1,000 years ago, where several distinct breeds were developed. Goldfish breeds vary 
        greatly in size, body shape, fin configuration, and coloration (various combinations of white, yellow, orange, red, brown, and black are known).</i></p></span>
